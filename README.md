## What is framethrower.py

This is a very simple Python library which extends the tkinter library
with the following widgets:

* GridFrame: a frame which makes it easier to place its contained widgets according to a grid layout
* ScrollingFrame: a frame which makes it easier to bind scrollbars to its contained widget
* ButtonFrame: a frame which generates horizontally ordered buttons

You can use the framethrower.py library by simply putting the file `framethrower.py` into the same directory with your Python project, and then by using the following import line:

```python
import framethrower as ft
```

The code was tested and was observed to be working with Python 2.7 and Python 3.6.
